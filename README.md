# Coffee Ordering System
A simple Java application to calculate the total cost of coffee orders based on the types of coffee and whether the order is for take-out or not. This project also demonstrates how to leverage Amazon Q Developer to accelerate the software development lifecycle (SDLC). [2]

## Features
Calculate the total cost of an order based on the coffee types ordered

Apply a discount for take-out orders

Support for Americano and Latte coffee types (more can be added easily)

Error handling for invalid coffee types

## Using Amazon Q Developer
This project showcases how Amazon Q Developer can be used to facilitate various stages of the SDLC:

### Requirements Gathering: 
Developers can provide feature requirements in any format (e.g., Markdown, plain text) to Amazon Q Developer, which can then generate a well-structured feature document in the Gherkin style (Given/When/Then) for Behavior-Driven Development (BDD).

### Implementation: 
Amazon Q Developer can assist in generating code snippets, unit tests, and implementation plans based on the feature requirements.

### Code Review: 
Amazon Q Developer can summarize pull request changes and comments, streamlining the code review process.

### Refactoring: 
Amazon Q Developer can suggest code refactoring opportunities and assist in implementing them, improving code quality and maintainability.

## Run the code

Should be nothing special but as usual for java developers.

```shell
cd amazonq-demo
gradle test
```
